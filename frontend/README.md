# I have made this Movie Explorer project with React+Vite for frontend and nodejs,express for backend.
# I have kept this project simple and clean. 
# I have use OMDb API for fetching the movies by title and uses axios for the same.
# I have use tailwind css as it is utility based so that our maintainibility does not get shifted.
