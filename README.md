# I have made a simple movie explorer web application using react+vite for frontend and nodeJs+express for backend.
# I have used OMDb API for fetching the movie by title.
# I have used axios package for integration of api and frontend with backend.
# I have kept the application simple.
# I have used tailwind css so that our maintainibility does not get shifted.
# I have displayed all the relevant information by title like year, poster photo and the main Title.
